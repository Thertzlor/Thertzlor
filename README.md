Hello there. I enjoy coding things. I like to work on projects that are niche and weird but still useful.

My personal philosophy is that programming and tools should fit the needs of the user, they should let you do whathever you *want* to do, without trying to be "opinionated".  

Languages I like to use:
* TypeScript/JavaScript
* lua
* Python
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
